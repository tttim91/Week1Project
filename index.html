We only source the highest quality maggots and crickets into our kitchen. We can't until you come down to Wok on Water and put some of our cockroaches in your mouth!

                    <h3>Be Healthy - Eat Chinese</h3>
                    <img src="http://uberhumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/lvCPN.jpg"/>
                    <p>
                        We at Wok on Water believe that Chinese food is the healthiest and best food in the world.  Any health advice you have heard - our suggestion is to add more Chinese food.  No matter what state you are in or what your goals are in life - our delicious "meats" and insects will help you get to where you want to be!  Any doctor who claims otherwise probably hasn't eaten enough Chinese food and therefore their ideas should not be trusted!
